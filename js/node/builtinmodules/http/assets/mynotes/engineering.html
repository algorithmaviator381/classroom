        <h2>Engineering</h2>
        <p>Most engineers are seen as highly intelligent and start working with machines early in life. I didn't have an
          extraordinary start in engineering. I got into it because I wanted to use computers for games and movies. Over
          time, I learned to love them, discovering that computer science connects to many other fields.</p>
        <p>Engineering is a creative process that involves finding a balance between consuming knowledge and creating
          new things. Which I happen to understand is not easily teachable, and it's based on years of experience.</p>
        <p>Starting with a simple "hello world" level is better than trying to do everything at once. I focused on
          getting basic functionality working first.</p>
        <p>I value courage in engineering. It's the willingness to tackle difficult problems, dive into unfamiliar code,
          and search for answers. Courage is about shifting from "impossible" to "figureoutable."</p>
        <p>I love experimenting with things. Computers were part of my life since I could walk and I was sort of a 
          computer geek in my school days but I was formally introduced to computer programming in my first year of college. 
          C++ was my first language followed by python and it has been the language of choice ever since (I also learnt 
          javascript only because I wanted to contribute to opensource projects like monkeytype and keybr). I kept coming back to it
          despite the challenges because I appreciate the complexity and effort behind computers.</p>
